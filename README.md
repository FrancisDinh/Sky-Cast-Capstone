## Machine Learning Nanodegree: Capstone Project
#### Author: Franklin Bradfield

Forecasting the future remains one of the most challenging problems in machine learning and data science in general. Recent successes toward this endeavor have utilized sequence-to-sequence neural network models, which is where I took inspiration from to produce this project. [Here](https://github.com/Arturus/kaggle-web-traffic) is a recent example the winning solution to a Kaggle competition that involved such an approach to forecast web time series.

In this machine learning project, I compare the performance of a traditional statistical technique, ARIMA, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on forecasting commercial airline data that I scraped from the U.S. Department of Transportation's [publicly available sources](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements.aspx).

The code for this was written in Python 2.7, using the latest versions of Python's standard scientific computing libraries - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, as well as statsmodels - Python's statistical modeling library, and Tensorflow - Google's deep learning library.

To reproduce the results, or to simply view and manipulate the code on your own machine, first setup and activate an environment with the required libraries below installed, then *$ cd* into the notebooks directory and run *$ jupyter notebook*. Exploratory data analysis can be found in data\_analysis.ipynb, while ARIMA\_time\_series.ipynb and RNN\_time\_series.ipynb contain time series models these models respectively.
